This code is a Python application for generating and managing industrial datasheets using a graphical interface built with tkinter. The DatasheetGeneratorApp class manages process conditions data and tag/instrument data from Excel files, allowing users to configure coordinates, filters, and transformations before generating formatted datasheets. It includes features for loading/saving settings, viewing data in various formats, configuring tag filters, and integrating with Excel workbooks through xlwings.
The core functionality revolves around taking data from instrument indices and process condition spreadsheets, mapping them to specific coordinates in template datasheets, and then generating new datasheets with the combined information. The app includes several helper functions for browsing files, configuring various parameters, and viewing the processed data.
